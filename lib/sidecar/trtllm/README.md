# TensorRT-LLM sidecar

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental.** The sidecars and their deployment examples are
> experimental. Manifests, flags, and behavior may change without notice.

`dynamo-trtllm-sidecar` connects a Dynamo worker to TensorRT-LLM's OpenEngine
gRPC server. See the [sidecar overview](../README.md) for installation.

> [!TIP]
> For the best and latest support, use the upstream TensorRT-LLM nightly image,
> which carries the latest gRPC server updates. Nightly builds are the
> `nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrt-llm/release:<version>.dev<date>` tags on
> [NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/tensorrt-llm/containers/release/-).

## Support matrix

| Feature | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Aggregated | Yes |
| Disaggregated | Yes |
| KV routing | No |

## Run locally

See [`launch/`](launch/) for all topologies. For example, aggregated serving on
one GPU:

```bash
export DYN_DISCOVERY_BACKEND=file   # single host: no etcd or NATS needed
lib/sidecar/trtllm/launch/agg.sh
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":32}'
```

## Deploy on Kubernetes

Before applying, replace `<your-registry>/dynamo-sidecar` in the manifest with a
[sidecar image](../README.md#docker) and create the `hf-token-secret`
Secret that the manifest reads.

See [`deploy/`](deploy/) for all manifests. For example, aggregated serving:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic hf-token-secret -n <namespace> \
  --from-literal=HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-token>
kubectl apply -f lib/sidecar/trtllm/deploy/agg.yaml -n <namespace>
kubectl port-forward -n <namespace> svc/trtllm-sidecar-agg-frontend 8000:8000
```

## Topologies

The frontend reaches each sidecar over Dynamo's request, discovery, and event
planes; the sidecar reaches the engine over its native gRPC API. The
TensorRT-LLM sidecar does not publish KV cache events.

### Single-Node TP

One engine on one node, with one sidecar.

![On one node, a request reaches the TensorRT-LLM tensor-parallel ranks through the Dynamo Sidecar. The Dynamo Frontend sends requests over the request plane to the sidecar.](../../../docs/fern/assets/img/sidecar-trtllm-single-node-tp.svg)

### Multi-Node TP

One engine spans two nodes. Only the leader node has a sidecar; the follower
node holds the remaining TP ranks.

![When one TensorRT-LLM engine spans two nodes with tensor parallelism, only the leader node runs a Dynamo Sidecar. The Dynamo Frontend sends requests over the request plane to the sidecar on Node 0.](../../../docs/fern/assets/img/sidecar-trtllm-multinode-tp.svg)

### Multi-Node DP

Not supported yet. The TensorRT-LLM sidecar does not target DP ranks or
publish KV events.

![TensorRT-LLM data parallelism across two nodes. Only the leader sidecar serves requests: the Dynamo Frontend router picks a DP rank and sends requests over the request plane to the node 0 Dynamo Sidecar, which registers DP ranks 0-3 and calls its local TensorRT-LLM over native gRPC.](../../../docs/fern/assets/img/sidecar-trtllm-multinode-dp.svg)
